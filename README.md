# DuplicateFileFinder
Actually I have created this application to search for similar songs on my computer. Using it I found multiple songs in different folders, but this application can be used for searching any kind similar files. Here we will also see how we can search for the similar files from the specified folder. As per the suggestions i have also updated the tool to search from file length as well as through file hash value. if you do the file length there are very rare chances of finding similar file even if they are different. but in case of file hash, there is no chances of grouping different fine and consider it as single one. File matching through hash will take more time then comparison through file length.
